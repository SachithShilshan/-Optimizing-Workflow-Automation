Title: Optimizing Workflow Automation: A Seamless Process Integration

Introduction:
In today's business landscape, efficiency and automation play pivotal roles in ensuring streamlined operations and maximizing productivity. This article/presentation outlines the implementation of an automated workflow aimed at optimizing the process of data extraction, transformation, and analysis. Leveraging advanced technology, we have seamlessly integrated various tools to create a cohesive and efficient workflow.

1. PDF Upload:
   - Users are required to upload the PDF document to a specific location designated for the process. This centralized approach ensures easy access and streamlined data management.

2. Data Extraction and Transformation:
   - Upon triggering the workflow, an AI model extracts relevant data from the uploaded PDF document.
   - Power Query is then utilized to transform the extracted raw data into a structured format that aligns with specific requirements.

3. Data Saving in SharePoint List:
   -Extracted data is automatically saved into a SharePoint list, providing a centralized repository for easy access and management.

5. Data Refresh:
   - The transformed data undergoes automatic refresh cycles, ensuring that the information remains current and up-to-date.
   - This automation eliminates the need for manual intervention, thereby saving time and resources.

6. Email Notifications:
   - Automated email notifications are dispatched upon successful data refresh, providing stakeholders with detailed steps and attached images illustrating the process.

7. FG Material Table Update:
   - Users are reminded to update or upload the FG material table as necessary to maintain data accuracy.
   - Access to the FG Material Table is provided via a SharePoint link, facilitating seamless collaboration and data sharing among team members.

8. Power BI Dashboard:
   - Processed data is showcased on a dynamic Power BI dashboard, offering users a comprehensive overview and insights into the workflow.
   - Users have the flexibility to view, export, and filter the data as needed, empowering them to make informed decisions based on real-time insights.
